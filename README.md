## ðŸ“– About This Repo  
This repository is my **personal self-study hub**, where I document my learning journey across different programming languages, frameworks, and tools.  
Each folder inside this repo represents a **topic** Iâ€™m studying, with notes, exercises, and projects.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals  
- Build strong foundations in **programming & development**  
- Document progress for accountability  
- Create a portfolio of small projects  
- Transition towards becoming a **full-stack developer**
